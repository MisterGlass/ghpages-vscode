# ghpages-vscode
An example Github Pages repo with a full IDE setup in VSCode

This is a very basic demonstration of VSCode as an IDE for Github Pages. You can:

    Open a Dev Container in VSCode with a preconfigured IDE
    Edit the markdoown files and use Markdown Preview to assist you
    Run a basic webserver with the key combo ctrl+shit+b (or run jekyll serve --force_polling in the container terminal) and browse the website
